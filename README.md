# Ubuntu

First install X2Go on your device:
- for Mac: http://go.unimelb.edu.au/c46r
- for OSX: http://go.unimelb.edu.au/746r
- for Windows: http://go.unimelb.edu.au/g46r

After opening X2Go, start a new session:
![new session](https://github.com/Meirian/Ubuntu/tree/master/images/new_session.png "new session")

Configure your session by entering the Session name, Host, Login and Session type:
![configuration](https://github.com/Meirian/Ubuntu/tree/master/images/configuration.png "configuration")
When configuring your Session, we use and recommend XFCE (“xface”). MATE is also an option. If you choose any others, you may find there are difficulties using the desktop.
